          description: "Input messages.\n\nOur models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nSee [input examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples).\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request."

When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nSee [input examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples).\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request."

You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.\n\nThere are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview\\#server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).\n\nEach tool definition includes:\n\n* `name`: Name of the tool.\n* `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.\n* `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.\n\nFor example, if you defined `tools` as:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"ticker\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAnd then asked the model \"What's the S&P 500 at today?\", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n    \"id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"input\": { \"ticker\": \"^GSPC\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{\"ticker\": \"^GSPC\"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"content\": \"259.75 USD\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nTools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.\n\nSee our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details."

You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nSee [input examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples).\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request."

          description: "Definitions of tools that the model may use.\n\nIf you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.\n\nThere are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview\\#server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).\n\nEach tool definition includes:\n\n* `name`: Name of the tool.\n* `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.\n* `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.\n\nFor example, if you defined `tools` as:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"ticker\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAnd then asked the model \"What's the S&P 500 at today?\", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n    \"id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"input\": { \"ticker\": \"^GSPC\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{\"ticker\": \"^GSPC\"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"content\": \"259.75 USD\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nTools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.\n\nSee our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details."

          description: "Input messages.\n\nOur models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nSee [input examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples).\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request."

          description: "Definitions of tools that the model may use.\n\nIf you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.\n\nThere are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview\\#server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).\n\nEach tool definition includes:\n\n* `name`: Name of the tool.\n* `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.\n* `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.\n\nFor example, if you defined `tools` as:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"ticker\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAnd then asked the model \"What's the S&P 500 at today?\", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n    \"id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"input\": { \"ticker\": \"^GSPC\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{\"ticker\": \"^GSPC\"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"content\": \"259.75 USD\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nTools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.\n\nSee our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details."
