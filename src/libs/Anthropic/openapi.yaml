          description: "Input messages.\n\nOur models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nStarting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"image\",\n    \"source\": {\n      \"type\": \"base64\",\n      \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n      \"data\": \"/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...\",\n    }\n  },\n  {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"}\n]}\n```\n\nWe currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.\n\nSee [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request."

You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.\n\nEach tool definition includes:\n\n* `name`: Name of the tool.\n* `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.\n* `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.\n\nFor example, if you defined `tools` as:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.\",\n    \"input_schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ticker\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"ticker\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAnd then asked the model \"What's the S&P 500 at today?\", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n    \"id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n    \"input\": { \"ticker\": \"^GSPC\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{\"ticker\": \"^GSPC\"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV\",\n    \"content\": \"259.75 USD\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nTools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.\n\nSee our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details."

          description: "Input messages.\n\nOur models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\n]\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\n]\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n```\n\nStarting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"image\",\n    \"source\": {\n      \"type\": \"base64\",\n      \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n      \"data\": \"/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...\",\n    }\n  },\n  {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"}\n]}\n```\n\nWe currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.\n\nSee [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nThere is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request."
